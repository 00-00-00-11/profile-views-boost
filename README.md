# Profile Views Booster
A script using requests to boost views on profile badges such as shields.io and komarev.com with proxies.

# Information
- This was requested from a friend a while back.
- This can basically pretty much be abused anywhere if you use your head.
- Proxies are required to have better use of this script, make sure that there is a proxies.txt file full of them. 
- If you have a shields.io badge on your .md file or repository, make sure to paste your ```https://camo.githubusercontent.com/``` link. 
- If you have a komarev.com badge, use the link they provide you.
- If you need any support, pm my <a href="https://t.me/nofbi">telegram</a>.
