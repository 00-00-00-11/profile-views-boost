# GitHub Profile Views Booster
A script using requests to boost views on profile badges such as shields.io and komarev.com with proxies.

# Information
Proxies are required to have better use of this script, make sure that there is a proxies.txt file full of them. If you have a shields.io badge on your .md file or repository, make sure to paste your ```https://camo.githubusercontent.com/``` link. If you have a komarev.com badge, use the link they provide you.
